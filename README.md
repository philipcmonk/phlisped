phlisp
======

phlisp is a language combined with the phlisped graphical editor.

To run, run `bin/run <filename>`.  To compile phlisp code, run `bin/phlisp <filename>`.

This is released completely as-is.  If you want help getting this to run, or if you want to understand the code, or the ideas behind it, go ahead and contact me.  You can leave a comment on my blog [0] or you can open an issue on GitHub.  This project is not under active development, but I'm still interested in graphical programming.
