c Deep semantic knowledge (i.e. create multiple ess-man's from same ess-expr) for:  let(-rec/-values)(*) define
c Light semantic knowledge (i.e. argument names) for:  if cond lambda [others?]
p Dynamic semantic knowledge (i.e. argument names) for:  user-defined functions

Full keyboard navigation:
	(for horizontal)
c	h,l -- move sibling
p	H,L -- move cousin
c	j,k -- move child/parent
p	J,K -- move ancestor/descendent ("hard" -- see note)
c	o,c -- open/close -- on open, if already open, open all children -- on close, close all descendents -- on close, pass selection to parent
p	O,C -- open/close "hard" (possibly breaking only at function level? -- i.e. don't follow "symbolic links")

c	need some kind of almost-inverse of open-many

x	allow multiple selection (particularly for open/close)? -- perhaps not (since we now have vertical navigation)
c	Selection follows the ess-expr in all cases except "close"

Replace Zoom-factor with reciprocal

Make prettier/faster text

Try changing perspective without clearing

Make zoom-out emphasize function names and use minor dimension space more efficiently
